## Habitat 

**Photonic scehdule**  
![](photonic.png)  
*(Fluval AqauSky LED app) As you can see from the schedule, the fish and plants have a clear diurnal schedule*

**Tidal schedule**  
*TBD*

* Temp: 76°F / 24.4°C
* Tap pH (6-8). Water conditioned with cholorine removal only
* No artificial / supplemental filtration beyond coarse and fine mechanical
* Bare bottom water column at tech end (wave maker / heater / filter intake). Makes refilling super easy, also serves as feeding area.
* 1 inch white sand substrate over washed soil. Some rocks in back to create subterranean space in 3 inches of soil. Heavier planting in the back for fish comfort (garden/forest end). Natural algae not removed from here for algaevores / undisturbed habitat.
